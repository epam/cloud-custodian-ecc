    As simple as it can be. Calculates coverage for some specific standard and

    Each standard has a concrete number N of so-called "controls".
    Coverage for a standard is a mean value of coverages of all its controls.
    Coverage for a control is ratio between number of rules that successfully
    verified this control and total number of rules that check for this
    control (currently we have no technical ability to take number of
    resources in consideration). Also, coverage for a control can be
    derived based on client's answers regarding some specific aspects of his
    infrastructure. Those controls must be provided from outside.
    User responses have higher priority.
